EA Public Interest Technologists is all about creating technology that helps
in doing large amounts of good. We keep a list of projects and people on this
page so that we can show off the fantastic people and work that's being done by
our community.

Our current organizers are [Sam Nolan](/people/SamNolan.html) and [Evelyn Fitzgerald](/people/evelynciara.html).

## What is public interest technology?

Public interest technology or public interest tech (PIT) is a field that combines expertise in technology, especially computing, with the common good. Public interest tech can be divided into two approaches:

* The application of computing and related technologies to serve the common good.
* Applying knowledge of computing and related technologies to public policy.

For more information, see the [public interest technology wiki entry](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/public-interest-technology) on the EA Forum.
