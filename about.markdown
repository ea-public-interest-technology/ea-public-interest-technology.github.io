EA Public Interest Technologists is all about creating technology that helps
in doing large amounts of good. We keep a list of projects and people on this
page so that we can show off the fantastic people and work that's being done by
our community.

Our current organizers are Sam Nolan and Evelyn Fitzgerald.
